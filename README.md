## About
This is my own take on an online, mobile-first [Cards Against Humanity](https://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/) clone. It's designed specifically with mobile in mind, allowing anyone with access to the internet to join & play. I used to play online clones like this in high school but none of them were great, so here we are.
